tinyhiss
========

A toy Smalltalk in Python

Uses https://github.com/darius/parson for the parser.

You can start it in a terminal window with `./tinyhiss.sh` and see
some instructions.

TODO Add changes.hiss to repo (and remove from .gitignore)? The
instructions in tile1 aren't really right otherwise. Alternatively,
add code to hiss.py to add the factorial method to the Number class.
